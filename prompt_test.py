Chrysanthemums.
HE  remarkable popularity of the Chrysanthemum  in
recent years can  hardly be classed  among  those
transient floral epidemics, so many of which are on record
in the history of horticulture. The rage for Sunflowers
and Daisies, with many another ephemeral caprice of this
sort, died out as suddenly as they arose, not because the
flower which chanced to be the prevailing fashion had no
merit, but because an exaggerated or fictitious beauty and
value were claimed for it. The interest in the Chrysanthemum has had a slow and steady development, and it is
based  on  the genuine  worth  of the flower.   It appears
at a time when rivals are few and its blooming period
extends over a long season. It ranges through a series of
rich, mellow tones of color, and no flower lends itself
more readily to the production of decorative effects. In form
it has the merit of symmetry, without a hint of rigid formality or any chilling suggestion  of artificiality, such as
characterizes a double  Dahlia  or a prize Camellia.   No
other flower equals it in the diversity of form which it
assumes within  the  limits of perfect proportion.   Each
variety and class of varieties shows such a marked individuality in the shaping and arrangement of its parts, or
such a delightful waywardness in the curving and twisting
of its florets, that one can examine a hundred flowers and
never find the outline of a single one repeated. When it
is remembered, too, how much of promise for the future of
the Chrysanthemum  there is in this free habit of blossoming out into novel and graceful forms, we can rest satisfied that not even the Rose will more securely maintain its
position as an established favorite among flowers.
The history of the Chrysanthemum's development from
its earlier and more simple garden forms, is most interesting.  It will suffice for our present purpose to note that
Loudon, in his Cyclopedia published in I824, speaks of
numerous varieties "recently obtained from China,"
where the flower had long been cultivated. He enumerates forty-four varieties, of which few are now to be
found in cultivation. The Large Lilac is one of those
which still may be found in old gardens on Long Island


445


and in other parts of this state. Perhaps several of them
still survive in old places still further south. Some of them,
like the Tasseled Yellow and White, the Yellow Waratah
and the Golden Lotus-flowered, would be appreciated now
if they could be re-introduced and cultivated under
approved modern methods.  Samuel Broome, in I857,
published a list of the varieties then growing in the Temple
Garden, London, and among them were 184 varieties of
what was known as the Chinese Chrysanthemum,
eighteen Large-flowered Anemones, I40 Pompons or Liliputs, and thirty Anemone Pompons.  Of these, there are
found in collections to-day, twenty-five Chinese, eight
Chinese Anemones, twenty-one Pompons and ten Anemone Pompons.  It is hardly twenty-five years since
flowers belonging to the Japanese section were introduced
to general notice.  It was in I865 that the Gardeners'
Chronicle reported that Mr. Veitch had sent home " three
very distinct forms, evidently the representatives of many
beautiful prodructions yet unborn,"  Two of them had
peculiar ligulate ray-flowers, all or nearly all of which were
drawn out into extremely narrow, sharp terminations, now
and then inclined to fork. The third was of quite another
kind, close-headed, incurved, with all the florets divided
into two irregular and unequal lips. The now famous
Grandiflorum was sent by Robert Fortune to John Standish,
of Ascot, and shown by him as early as i862.  At the
same time were exhibited Laciniatum and Japonicum,
the former spoken of as a "distinct Japanese variety of
the Chinese Chrysanthemum with white flower-heads
composed of fringed tubular petals." The report speaks
of the latter as being remarkable for its slender, tubular,
curved florets.  How  all these peculiarities, have been
intensified since their introduction, and fused together
into new combinations, is made plain in any ordinary collection to-day.
Enthusiastic cultivators in this country recognized the
value of the Chrysanthemum long ago, but it is scarcely
more than seven years since this flower first attained
its real popularity here. Mr. H. P. Walcott, in Boston,
Mr. W. K. Harris, in Philadelphia, and Mr. John Thorpe,
in New York, were most conspicuous in bringing it
into public favor.  The importation  from  Japan, by
Waterer, of some fifty varieties, in I883, many of which
were most distinct and beautiful, gave a new impulse to
hybridizing, and now the new kinds that appear every
year are almost numberless. At least Io,ooo tried seedlings have been on exhibition for the first time this year.
The diversity of form and color displayed is almost infinite, and the various strains have been so intercrossed that
the seeds from a single flower-head will often produce examples of the types most widely separated in structure and
size, together with intermediate and kindred forms. The
strong propensity of the Chrysanthemum to variation has
been of great advantage to the originators of new varieties,
and, by careful selection, the improvement in color
has been as striking as the changes in form.  Shades
and tints which were unknown in this flower a decade
ago are now common.  Maroons, crimsons, rose, pink
and buff have all become more decided. The markings
of parti-colored flowers upon the tips and along the marginal lines have become more distinct, and the production
of a scarlet flower is not despaired of by those who have
done the most to bring out the newer and formerly unknown shades. It is small wonder, then, that exhibitions
devoted exclusively to Chrysanthemums have been held
in at least a dozen of our cities this year, while only four
years ago Boston, New York and Philadelphia alone had


such displays.
No one can prophesy in what direction the next marked
improvement in the Chrysanthemum may be looked for;
but, judging from the past, striking variations from the
forms we are now familiar with may be expected. Those
who studiously note the development of new seedlings are
quick to mark the appearance of slight peculiarities, for
these may be the forerunners of distinct types. For some

HE  address by  Major J. W. Powell, Director of the
United States Geological Survey, before the Chamber
of Commerce of this city, on December 5th, on "Problems of
Irrigation," was an eloquent and suggestive discourse. He
explained that there are nearly a thousand million acres of
arid lands in the United States, or one-half of the area of
the country, excluding Alaska. Nearly one hundred and
twenty million acres can be irrigated when all the available  water is used.   More  than  six  million  acres  are
already cultivated by means of canals. The great resource
for irrigation is the use of the rivers, and accumulated capital and organized industry are necessary for the construction  of reservoirs  and  other works required.   " Capital
must come, for the work is demanded and will pay." He
thinks it will cost about ten dollars an acre to redeem the
arid land, and fifty dollars aln acre he regards as a small
estimate of its value after it is put uinder irrigation, and thus
the investment of a thousand millions of dollars will yield
five times that sum by the redemption of a hundred millions of acres. Where agriculture depends upon irrigation,
if there is more land  than  the water will supply, values
inhere in water, not in land, as land without water is without
value.
The arid land, he said, is now mostly in the possession
of the general Government, and it is important to determine
how the water shall be divided. When all the water of the
Arkansas River is utilized it will irrigate only about onethird of the land of the valley. The people of Kansas
want this water, and say it should be left in the river channel till it runs down to them, and they are usifg some of
it, and the people of Colorado have taken a large part of it
out on their lands. When seasons of drought come they
permit no water to flow across the state line, and the agricultural property below is threatened with destruction. If every
man may take out water as he pleases, the men along the
river below are at the mercy of those above them. This is
an inter-state problem to be settled by the general Government. Already there is conflict between farmer and farmer,
between different counties and between states.
In Major Powell's judgment, the foot of the steep slopes,
the point at which the river enters the plain, is the place at


i3


which the water should be taken from the river channel
for irrigation. If permitted to flow farther down much of
it will be lost by evaporation, and it will take up mud
which will choke the reservoirs. The general Government
should determine where these waters are to be used, and
should exercise supervision in this matter when it disposes
of its lands to actual settlers, taking into account the welfare of the greatest number of people yet to find homes.
Montana and the two Dakotas are interested in the water
of the upper Missouri, and there is not enough for all the
arid land of the valley. How shall it be divided? The
Rio Grande del Norte is, in a part of its course, the boundary between this country and Mexico. The division of its
water is an international question.
We quote from a noticeable passage on mountain forests:
"On the mountains and plateaus of the arid lands great isorests are found. To a large extent they are composed of coniferous trees-Pines, Firs, Hemlocks and Sequoias. The plains
and valleys below, where agriculture by irrigation is to be carried on, are treeless and alnmost naked of grass. The forests
flourish where the rains fall in the regions above, but these
forest lands are not agricultural for climatic reasons, as snow
and frosts prevent farming in those regions. It is thus that
the forest lands and the agricultural lands are severed. They
are often far away from each other-tens, scores and hundreds
of miles apart. The people below on their farms, and in their
villages and cities, require this tim ber for their domestic use, and
they are thle people primarily interested. But these farmers have
still other interests in the forest lands. The mountains where
the forests grow are the catchment areas for the waters which
they must use, and, to a large extent, the mountain lakes are
natural reservoirs for the waters of irrigation, and many of
the mountain valleys must be converted into reservoir lakes
by the hand of man. So the management of these forests
and forest lands should be in the hands of the men who use
the timber and who must control the waters. If they are unwisely destroyed, the sources of water supply are impaired.
Consider how these forests are destroyed. More than two decades ago I was camped in the Middle Park, of Colorado. The
night was arched with the gloom of snow clouds, so I kindled
a fire at the trunk of a great Pine, and in the chill of the evening I gazed at its welcome flames. Soon I saw it mount, climbing the trunk, crawling among the branches, igniting the rough
bark, kindling the cones and setting fire to the needles, until
in a few minutes the great forest Pine was all one pyramid of
flame, which illuminated a temple in the wilderness domed by
a starless night. Soon the fire flakes were borne by the winds
to other trees, and the forest was ablaze. On it spread with
the winds, and the lingering storm  camle not to extinguish it.
Still on it swept for miles and scores of miles, until more
timber was destroyed than has been used by the people of
Colorado for the last ten years. It is thus that, under conditions of civilization, the great forests of the arid lands are
being swept from the mountains and plateaus.
"The people of this country, witnessing this vast destruction
of values and the deterioration of the water sources of arid
lands, are appealing to the general Government for a Forestry
Commission-the establishment by law of armies of men to
protect the forests, and they propose that the general Government shall engage in timber culture and in the timber business, holding the lands in the possession of the Government
and selling the timber to the people who live below. For this
purpose thousands and scores of thousands of men will be
needed, a formidable list of offices must be created, and officeholders multiplied.
" The great forests that clothe the hills, plateaus and mountains with verdure must be protected from devastation by fire
and preserved for the use of man, that farms may be protected
and homes built; and that all this wealth of forestry, those unborn cottages and school-houses may be distributed among
the people."
How is all this to be provided for? Major Powell says
to the general Government, "Hands off!" He would organize the people of each river drainage area, or hydrographic
basin, into a great irrigation district, under national and


state laws, and then let them make their own laws for the
division of the water, for the protection and use of the
forests, for the protection of the pasturage on the hills, and
for the use of the water-power:
"This, then, is the proposition I make: That the entire
arid region be organized into natural hydrographic districts,

A Road in Sherwood Forest............................................. 203


An English Forest.
N old English forest is a very beautiful and interesting thing, although, judged by the standard of modern forest science, it is practically a useless encumbrance
of the earth, to be cleared away that the ground it occupies
may be replanted to better advantage. Such a forest is
that of Sherwood, in Nottinghamshire, the most famous and
historically the most interesting of all the remnants of the
ancient forest-covering of Britain. A view taken in this
forest appears in our illustration on page 203, and represents a portion of the high-road leading through "Bircklands," as one part of Sherwood Forest is called, because
Birches grow in great numbers among the old Oaks. The
forest-floor is densely covered with Bracken (Plerns aquil
zina), making a charming carpet among the trees, which
stand singly, often with wide places between them and
unsurrounded with young trees growing up to replace
them. Deer and rabbits have frequented Sherwood Forest for centuries, and it has been pastured at times and
sadly neglected and abused; every seedling-tree, as fast
as it appears among the Ferns, is nibbled off and destroyed, and no successors to the great old trees have been
allowed to grow up to take their place when they have
lived out their long lives. Very few of the old trees are
left; multitudes of them fell a century or more ago to
replenish the purses of needy noblemen, and time has
laid a heavy hand upon those which escaped. And now this
forest, which is really not a forest at all, but rather a thickly
planted park, bears about the same relation to a modern
European forest that an English farm, with its wide, useless
hedgerows, its broad branched Elms shading the ground,
sucking up moisture from the earth and using up plant
food, its game carefully protected to feed upon the crops,
and all its wasteful methods of pasturage, bears to a modern German farm, in which every inch of ground is made
productive and not one ounce of anything is wasted.
A drive through Sherwood Forest is one of the most delightful things an American can do in England, although
he will not learn much about forestry on his trip or see
many things which can be applied in his every-day life at


I97


home. A visit to Sherwood Forest and "the Dukeries,"
as a number of country places made in what was once a
part of the old forest and lying adjacent to each other are
called, is a common English holiday trip for people living
in the cities of the midland counties, and thousands make
it every year. The excursion is easily made from the town
of Worksop, in Nottinghamshire, and a day is needed to
make the circuit of thirty miles through the different
estates and the remnants of the forest. Two or three days,
however, can be well employed in the neighborhood of
Worksop if the visitor is interested in gardens and in fine
houses as well as in old trees. One may see in these two
or three days Worksop Manor and park, lying close by
the town-a fine park, now the property of the Duke of
Newcastle, the house, however, much reduced by fire from
its old estate. It was the home of the Earls of Shrewsbury,
and stout Bess of Hardwick built the mansion or finished
it, and ruled over its destinies, as she did in one way or
another over all the great families of the county. Mary
Queen of Scots was once a prisoner in this house. There
are a few fine trees in the park, including a group of noble
Oaks not far from the mansion. A little beyond Worksop
Manor the high-road leads into the enclosure of the park of
Welbeck Abbey, where the visitor will find the winners of
two successive Derbys and the most successful breeding
establishment in the history of the English turf.
Just beyond Welbeck is Clumber, the seat of the Duke
of Newcastle. The house is low and badly placed, and
dwarfed, moreover, by the ugly church just completed,
which is placed too near the mansion, with whose architecture it does not harmonize. The handsome terrace
joining the house with the lake is one of the most successful in England; and the view across the lake to the rolling
park beyond is very fine. There are noble trees in the
pleasure grounds and in the park, and the lake, with its
margins lined with wild plants and stocked with wild fowl,
is certainly a most wonderful imitation of nature. The
view of the mansion from  one of the drives where it
crosses a narrow arm of the lake on an old arched
stone bridge is deservedly famous. The house contains
many fine pictures and other works of art. What will
strike, perhaps, the American visitor to Clumber are the
countless thousands of rabbits running about every part of
the place, which seems completely undermined with their
burrows. The park contains no herds of deer, which
abound at Welbeck, and in Thoresby Park, which is just
beyond Clumber, and from which it is separated by two
pairs of gates.
Thoresby, the seat of Earl Manvers, by far the most
beautiful of " the Dukeries," and one of the most interesting
places in all England, has a noble new Elizabethan mansion,
built on high ground, overlooking the large artificial lake,
close by which the old house stood. The park is twelve
miles round, and contains many interesting and exciting
views and many noble trees. Not far from the house is a
small-leaved Linden-tree not easily matched anywhere,
and across the lake is an avenue a mile long of splendid
old Chestnut-trees of immense size, forming a long vista
which loses itself in the mysterious depths of Sherwood
Forest beyond. In the shubberies near the house, although
not very long planted, are the finest specimens of the Hemlock-tree of the high Sierra Nevada (Tsuga Pallonzana)
which can be seen in Europe. The present Earl Manvers
is a planter of trees, as the young plantations all over the
estate bear witness; and at one point the drive leads
through a real forest of Beech-trees, with tall, straight
trunks, which a German forest-master would not be ashamed
of. Deer wander through the park right up to the terracewall and to the gates of the courtyard, and from the house


great flocks of sheep and herds of cattle can be seen feeding under the park trees, giving life and variety to the
scene and adding much to its attractiveness.
Passing out of Thoresby Park gates the road leads
directly into Sherwood Forest at the point where the view
in our illustration was made. Then it stretches through

# also they are listed as all being on the first page, but this is not the case
# The chat model broke this up into three different articles, each with the same staring page.
# The model Need instructions on how to handle these

#Round 2

#In this iteration:
# -Further clrafification on not making changes to page numbers
# -Specifying that each JSON should have three keys even if there is not author value
# -Asking not break up article titles that look like lists into multiple articles.
# -Delivering prompt and input together each time

You are a helpful assistant who is helping librarians work with digital text collections with OCR. In your job, you are helping extract relevant pieces of information from the OCR associated with a Table of Contents from a historic academic journal on gardening, horticultrue, and forestry.
When given the OCR for these pages you identify the Article titles, authors, and page numbers for each entry in the Table of Contents and return then in a valid JSON format with the following keys "Article Title", "Author", and "Page Number".
The Author value is optional and will not appear for each and every entry in the table of contents.Each returned JSON should have each of the three keys, even if no value is returned for Author. In that case, leave the value as an empty string.
You do not make any corrections or changes to the OCR data for the extracted information. Even if the articles, authors, or page numbers seem to include typos, errors, or other issues, you only return the raw text in the JSON without changes. For the page numbers OCR you may find issues in which digits have been rendered as alphabetical characters by the OCR process. Do not correct when these kinds of page number issues arise
Each value for extracted from the OCR and returned in the JSON should be a string, even for page numbers.
You may find instances where an article title appears to be a list of multiple article titles. Do not separate them into distinct JSON entries.
In the page OCR you may find seciton headings like "Editorial Articles" or "Correspondes". These are to be excluded for the returned data. Additionally, nothing from the Illustrations seciton should be included or returned.

Here is the OCR:

#In this iteration:
# -Include raw line data

Prompt_4 = '''
You are a helpful assistant who is helping librarians work with digital text collections with OCR. In your job, you are helping extract relevant pieces of information from the OCR associated with a Table of Contents from a historic academic journal on gardening, horticultrue, and forestry.
When given the OCR for these pages you identify the Article titles, authors, and page numbers for each entry in the Table of Contents and return then in a valid JSON format with the following keys "Article Title", "Author", and "Page Number".
The Author value is optional and will not appear for each and every entry in the table of contents. Each returned JSON should have each of the three keys, even if no value is returned for Author. In that case, leave the value as an empty string.
You do not make any corrections or changes to the OCR data for the extracted information. Even if the articles, authors, or page numbers seem to include typos, errors, mixes of Roman numerals, letters, and digtis, or other issues, you only return the raw text in the JSON without changes. For the page numbers OCR you may find issues in which digits have been rendered as alphabetical characters by the OCR process. Do not correct when these kinds of page number issues arise.
Each value for extracted from the OCR and returned in the JSON should be a string, even for page numbers.
You may find instances where an article title appears to be a list of multiple article titles. Do not separate them into distinct JSON entries.
In the page OCR you may find seciton headings like "Editorial Articles" or "Correspondes". These are to be excluded for the returned data. Additionally, nothing from the Illustrations seciton or below should be included or returned.

Furthermore, for each entry in the JSON, include another key call "line" in which you provide the raw OCR line or lines (concatenated into a single string) from which you derived that particular entry in the table of contents. Let this be the first key in the JSON.
Additionally, before returning you JSON to me, please run a check of your JSON against the materials in the orginal OCR. In this check, please confirm that titles, authors, and page numbers that you extracted are the exactly the same as their corresponding substrings from the OCR, without any changes besides them being removed from context. If your extracted JSON values differ in any way, please extract the exact substrings again. Please confirm to me that you conducted this check before returning you JSON.

Here is the OCR:

#TO DO - Oct 23:
#  -Rethink workflow --> extract from AI ---> then manual review
#     let it make changes to title and page numbßr; check if changes made to title
#  -rework prompts; get title and raw line; let it make changes; then test
#     nested approach with headings

#In this iterations:
#   let it make fixes to typos
#   ask for what it makes changes
#   makes nested headings
#   still takes lines

The Author value is optional and will not appear for each and every entry in the table of contents. Each returned JSON should have each of the keys, even if no value is returned for Author. In that case, leave the value as an empty string.

Frequently, articles will be featured under headings like "EDITORIAL ARTICLES", "FOREIGN CORRESPONDENCE", "CULTURAL DEPARTMENT", etc. These headings sometimes appear in all-caps. 
Furthermore, for each article JSON dictionary, include a "Heading" key with the corresponding heading it is under. Feel free to make any corrections to the heading if you notice typos or errors, but note them in the "Changes" key of the JSON dictionary.
If an article does not appear to have a specific section heading associated with it, assume the most recent previous heading applies to it.

Only extract data in the table of contents after the "Table of Contents" reference in the OCR. Do not
While the OCR page text you receive my include much more text beyond the table of contents, only extract information from the table of contents.
Also, if you reach the "Illustrations" section stop there and do not include anything in the illustrations section.
